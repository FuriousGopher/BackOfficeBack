# Slot Machine Web App Backend


## Overview

This repository contains the backend code for a small web application's slot machine game. It serves as the backend logic for user registration, authentication, and game functionality. The project is designed to showcase my full-stack development skills and serves as a test project for a full-stack job application.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can create accounts with a unique username and password.
- User Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication with token stored in cookies.
- PostgreSQL Database: Data, including user information and game records, is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- Slot Machine Game: Implements the logic for a simple slot machine game with coin management.
